4. Intelligent Timetable Optimization & Scheduling Assistant
The Challenge: Educational institutions increasingly struggle with dynamic class scheduling due to
limited infrastructure, overlapping departmental requirements, faculty constraints, and multidisciplinary
course offerings.
Traditional manual or spreadsheet-based timetable generation fails to handle real-time variables like
faculty availability, room occupancy, teaching load norms, elective overlaps, and student preferences.
The result is timetable clashes, underutilized classrooms, uneven workloads, and frustration for students
and staff alike.
What to Build:
Develop a scheduling platform that autonomously generates and optimizes academic timetables across
multiple departments, programs, and shifts. The system should consider the following parameters as
variables for creating optimized timetables:
• Number of classrooms available
• Number of batches of students
• Number of subjects to be taught in a particular semester
• Names of subjects
• Number of classes to be conducted for a subject per week/per day
• Number of faculties available for different subjects
(Students may also consider additional variables that may help in effective timetable preparation.)
Demo Requirements:
A functional web-based prototype that demonstrates:
• Authorized login and role-based access (admin, department head, faculty)
• Data entry module for faculty, rooms, subjects, and student batches
• Real-time generation of multiple optimized timetable options
• Clash detection and intelligent rearrangement suggestions by AI
• Visualization dashboard showing room utilization, faculty load balance, and scheduling
efficiency
• Factor in dynamic inputs – real-time faculty availability, leaves, course prerequisites, room
capacities, and elective combinations
• Display workload imbalances or potential scheduling conflicts before finalization
• Offer adaptive rescheduling in response to sudden changes (faculty leave, room unavailability,
event scheduling)
